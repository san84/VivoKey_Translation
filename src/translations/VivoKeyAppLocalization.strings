 Instructions:
 The data is arranged in "Key" = "Value" form, some notes are after //... notes don't affect the value of the data.

             Only modify this part inside the [" "].
                       |
                       V
 "SomeKey" = "This is the text for SomeKey"  // This is just a note

 Replace the "Value" or comment out [//] the complete sentense.

 // "SomeKey" = "This is the text for SomeKey"  // This is just a note
    "SomeKey" = "Este es el texto para SomeKey"

 Note, don't add any more ["]

 To make the work easier, I recommend you install a text editor that can color code a *.strings type of file:

 Download Microsoft's Visual Studio Code text editor:
 https://code.visualstudio.com

 Install an extension to highlight Keys vs Values vs Comments to make it easier to work:

 Let me know if you have any questions:
